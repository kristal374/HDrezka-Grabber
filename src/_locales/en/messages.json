    "message": "This is not a bug in the extension but a feature of the website. To play a movie, the player requests a link to the video of the required quality from the server. If the server is overloaded, it may automatically lower the quality — for example, deliver 720p instead of 1080p. The extension receives exactly the link the server returns. You can verify this directly on the site: the quality in the player will also drop."

  "settings_FaqAnswer_3": {

    "message": "How does the extension work?"
  },
  "settings_FaqAnswer_4": {
    "message": "When you open the dropdown menu, the extension checks whether you are on a suitable website. If it's not a movie or series on a rezka.ag family site, it simply shows a placeholder and stops. If the page is suitable, the extension retrieves the player data (episode, voiceover, parameters, etc.). To do this, a temporary script is inserted into the page, which collects the necessary information and passes it to the extension. When you click \"Download\", the extension generates a file name and requests from the server a list of links to videos of different qualities. The extension selects the required link and sends it to the browser, which starts the download. After that, the extension simply monitors the download and reacts to its events. It can also manage several downloads at once."

  },
  "settings_FaqQuestion_6": {
    "message": "Does the extension support other mirrors of the site?"
  },
  "settings_FaqAnswer_6": {
    "message": "Yes, it does. When opening the popup, the extension checks whether the site matches the structure pattern of rezka.ag; if not, it will inform you that the site is not recognized and suggest visiting the official rezka.ag site. Since all OFFICIAL mirrors follow the pattern, they will work without issues, but keep in mind: besides official mirrors, there may be others! In rare cases, the pattern in the extension may become outdated — then downloading may be impossible even from the official site."

  },
  "settings_FaqQuestion_8": {
    "message": "Does the extension support background downloading?"
  },
  "settings_FaqAnswer_8": {
    "message": "Yes. The extension supports background downloading. The extension itself initiates the download, and as long as the browser is running, it will continue downloading files."
  },
  "settings_FaqQuestion_9": {
    "message": "How are files downloaded, does it use the torrent protocol?"
  },
  "settings_FaqAnswer_9": {
    "message": "No — the torrent protocol is not used. The extension imitates the way the player works on the website and uses streaming data transfer. If you're interested in the legal aspects of using the extension: the extension is merely an external interface for downloading from the site, and all legal questions should be addressed to the site administration, not the extension."
